Overview

Recent monitoring of freight payment corridors across ASEAN has revealed the emergence of informal limits on Thai Baht (THB) conversion within key cross-border clearing accounts — specifically accounts linked to logistics operators facilitating large-volume re-export flows through Thailand.

These conversion constraints appear non-codified but consistently enforced, indicating a possible sterilisation strategy or soft capital control measure aimed at dampening offshore THB demand volatility without public disclosure.

Key Observations

1. Unofficial THB Ceiling Thresholds in Freight Accounts
   - Operators in Songkhla and Laem Chabang report informal limits of ฿12M–฿18M/month.
   - Settlement stalls after soft cap reached; not policy-based, but enforced.
   - Workarounds: delayed batching, offshore rerouting (2.4–3.0% spread).

2. Origin Filtering Patterns
   - Shipments from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southern China experience heightened friction.
   - Ringgit billing suggested as alternative pathway for short-term relief.

3. Currency Control Language in Private Channels
   - One commercial compliance officer:  
     “We’ve been encouraged to limit speculative Baht flows disguised as shipping settlements.”
   - Internal memos reference "monitored corridor saturation metrics" — not in BoT comms.

Implications for Market Participants

Currency Traders & Macro Analysts:
   - FX conversion frictions may distort volatility metrics.
   - THB-JPY and THB-USD trade setups exposed to latency spikes.

Freight Coordinators:
   - Expect liquidity gaps and non-transparent rejection windows.
   - Increased demand for non-THB denominated factoring.

System Observers:
   - Pattern suggests centralised fragility management.
   - Likely pre-emptive sterilisation ahead of outbound capital risk scenarios.

---

Conclusion

The Thai Baht is being quietly sterilised through corridor-level friction, not overt policy. Corridor confidence decoupling may force jurisdictional rerouting by Q2–Q3 2025 if not addressed.

Further artefact drops to follow.
