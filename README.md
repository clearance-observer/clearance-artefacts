# clearance-artefacts

This repository contains artefacts generated and deployed under structured clearance protocols to surface latent risk, jurisdictional fragility, and systemic signal distortions. Each artefact follows a standardised formatting, hashing, and relay procedure to ensure traceability, metadata discipline, and passive indexing.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder follows the naming convention: `AR-[ASSET/CODE]-[DATE/ID]`

Example:
- `AR-THB-CX20250413/` – Thai Baht sterilisation signal
- `AR-ENS-0425-A/` – ENS LP unlock routing anomaly

---

## 🔖 Artefact Components

Each artefact folder may include:
- `.md` → Canonical markdown-formatted artefact
- `.txt` → Pastebin/Discord raw drop version
- `.pdf` → Professional mirror-ready version
- `SHA3-*.txt` → Hash integrity verification
- `*-CommitRef.txt` → Optional Git-based trigger logs (if relevant)

## 🛰 Signal Metadata Tags

Used in extended commit messages and artefact headers:

| Tag                  | Purpose                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#THBcorridor`       | Jurisdiction or asset (e.g. currency corridors)            |
| `#freightnode`       | Physical/logistics-layer infrastructure observation        |
| `#sterilisationwatch`| Currency sterilisation or silent capital control exposure  |
| `#clearnetnode`      | Mirror suitable for open-web passive indexing              |
| `#AR-[...]`          | Artefact ID for traceability across systems                |

## 🛡 Clearance Tier Definitions

| Tier     | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tier 2A  | Passive relay. Designed for public visibility with embedded metadata.       |
| Tier 2B  | Shadow relay. Indexable, but attribution-scrubbed and meant for system actors.|
| Tier 3   | Encrypted/internal. Not deployed to clearnet unless explicitly stated.       |
